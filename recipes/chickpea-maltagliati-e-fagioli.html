    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chickpea lasagna sheets are broken into "badly cut" (maltagliati) pieces and cooked with cranberry beans for a twist on the traditional Italian stew.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried cranberry beans</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh sage</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>kitchen twine</li>
        <li>4 ounces chickpea lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>20 fresh green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>10 cherry tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bird's eye chile, minced (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 cups water (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 cube vegetable bouillon</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak beans in water, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain beans and briefly rinse under cold water. Allow to drain.</li>
        <li>Tie sage, rosemary, and bay leaf with kitchen twine. Set aside. Break lasagna sheets into uneven pieces that are relatively the same size.</li>
        <li>Heat a stovetop pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil, onion, carrots, and red bell pepper; stir until onion is translucent. Add drained beans, herb bundle, green beans, cherry tomatoes, garlic, and chile pepper. Stir to ensure beans are evenly distributed. Add 4 cups water and bouillon cube. Secure the lid and bring to pressure. Cook for 8 minutes from the first whistle.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and allow pressure to release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions. Remove cover and discard herb bundle. Season stew with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Add pasta pieces a few at a time, stirring constantly to avoid sticking.</li>
        <li>Add boiling water a little at a time if the stew becomes too thick. Stir frequently until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Ladle into 4 bowls. Top each bowl with 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
